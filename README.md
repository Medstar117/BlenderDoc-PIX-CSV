# BlenderDoc PIX CSV
A Blender plugin for importing model data from PIX CSV formatted files generated by RenderDoc. This is a stand-alone fork of Stanislav Bobovych's "import_pix.py" script, which is part of his "Game Tools" repository. I have my own reasons for wanting to do this; but one can, for example, do things from seeing how one's 3D model is being rendered in a given application (aka, debugging why their model is looking all janky) or to making a STL file of their favorite 3D model from a game or whatnot more effectively.

I only say this one thing if you choose to use this plugin--**don't be stupid.** Don't go around stealing assets from different games and such for your own personal gain (i.e. don't go around making models and such from games and making money off of it--that's highly illegal). If you're wanting to do it for a personal, non-commercial project, so be it; but if you get in trouble with the autorities or with whomever you stole assets from, that's on **you**. I hold no responsibility for you using this plugin like that.

Please heed the above warning. Be smart.

## Details to note
The original script was made for Blender 2.7.8. The goal is to port this plugin to work with Blender 2.83.3. The following checklist details the goals of this project:

- [X] Get the plugin to work with Blender 2.83.3 LTS (meshes only)
- [ ] Clean up script of leftover/debuging data
- [X] Configure script to be more dynamic in data retrieval (i.e. don't make the script assume that a specific column will have a certain piece of data every time)
- [X] Fix normals importing
- [ ] Fix UV importing
- [ ] Add bone importing
- [ ] Add Tangent importing
- [ ] Add Binormal importing
